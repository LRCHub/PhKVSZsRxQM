Well it was ice cold when you left
Baby pass the chapel pass the steps
Ride my bike through the school
But I'm still thinking about you

And walking by the Thames
Mulled wine out with my friends
Ride a sleigh on the heath
But Santa's not been good to me

Ooh snow on the floor
Wanna knock on my door
Open your heart
Tell me I'm yours
I wish I were giving you a gift this Christmas
Now honey come home

Ooh winter was bleak
In a couple of weeks,
You're gonna come running back to your mamas feet
I wish I were giving you a gift this Christmas
Now honey come home

There's one thing on my list
The tree is loaded up with gifts
It's not a thing without you here
I won't wait another year

Ooh snow on the floor
Wanna knock on my door
Open your heart
Tell me I'm yours
I wish I were giving you a gift this Christmas
Now honey come home

Ooh winter was bleak
In a couple of weeks,
You're gonna come running back to your mamas feet
I wish I were giving you a gift this Christmas
Now honey come home
Come home Mikey

Friend tonight
The coldest night of my life
Don't be scared
(I need a)
