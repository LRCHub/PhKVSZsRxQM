Try to imagine a house that's not a home
Try to imagine a Christmas all alone
That's where I'll be
Since you left me.
My tears would melt the snow
What can I do
Without you
I've got no place, no place to go.

It'll be lonely this Christmas
Without you to hold
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold
It'll be cold, so cold
Without you to hold
This Christmas.

Each time I remember
The day you went away
And how I would listen
To things you have to say
I just break down
As I look around
And the only things I see
Are emptiness and loneliness
And an unlit Christmas tree.

It'll be lonely this Christmas
Without you to hold
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold
It'll be cold, so cold
Without you to hold
This Christmas.

You remember last year?
When you and I were here
We never thought there'd be an end.
And I remember looking at you then thinking
That Christmas must have been made for you and for me
Cause darlin'
This is the time that you really need love
When it means so very very much.

It'll be lonely this Christmas
Without you to hold
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold
It'll be cold, so cold
Without you to hold
This Christmas.
